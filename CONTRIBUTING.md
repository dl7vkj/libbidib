# Contributing to libbidib

These are some contribution guidelines that should conserve a consistent code
base. Please stick to the guidelines when contributing to libbidib.

## Code contributions

The whole code base uses smart tabs for indentation. This means, tabs are
used for indentation and spaces are used for alignment. A good explanation can
be found in the [Emacs wiki](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SmartTabs).

The line width shall preferably not exceed 80 characters and shall never
exceed 100 characters, using a tab size of four spaces.
